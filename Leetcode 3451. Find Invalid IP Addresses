Leetcode 3451. Find Invalid IP Addresses
I DID IT on 20260129!

WITH ic
     AS (SELECT ip,
                CASE
                  WHEN ip ~ '[3-9]+[0-9]+[0-9]'
                        OR ip ~ '2[6-9]+[0-9]'
                        OR ip ~ '25[6-9]' THEN 1
                  WHEN ip LIKE '0%'
                        OR ip ~ '\.0' THEN 1
                  WHEN ip !~ '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' THEN 1
                END AS invalid_check
         FROM   logs)
SELECT ip,
       SUM(invalid_check) AS invalid_count
FROM   ic
WHERE  invalid_check IS NOT NULL
GROUP  BY ip
ORDER  BY invalid_count DESC,
          ip DESC; 


After reading ours' solution, I improved mine.
SELECT ip,
       Count(*) AS invalid_count
FROM   logs
WHERE  ip ~ '[3-9]+[0-9]+[0-9]'
        OR ip ~ '2[6-9]+[0-9]'
        OR ip ~ '25[6-9]'
        OR ip LIKE '0%'
        OR ip ~ '\.0'
        OR ip !~ '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'
GROUP  BY ip
ORDER  BY invalid_count DESC,
          ip DESC;
